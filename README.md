<h3><b> Exercise Description </b></h3>

This project is a C# service that provides Weather forecast APIs. When you call it, the response will define descriptions or summary based on the temperature, for example <b>if the temperature in C is below 10 degrees then your service response summary description will be "cold"</b>, as demontrated below.

```
{
"date": "2022-07-05T15:12:22.6982122-03:00",
"temperatureC": 5,
"temperatureF": 40,
"summary": "cold"
}
```

Your Product Owner wants the temperature descriptions to be more accurate and defines a new requirement that states:

When the temperature is under 0 degrees Celsius, the description should be “freezing”
